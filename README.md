# Tracer
A "simple" C++ RayTracer

The goals are to produce high quality images fast using interesting techniques.

Started out as a lightning fast Raytracer (phong/diffuse/shadow samples and all that), but now has pathtracer renderer alongside it. 

It's pretty cool, but hopefully it'll be cooler soon.
