# Tracer
A "simple" C++ RayTracer

The goals are to produce high quality images fast using interesting techniques, with a nice Lua interface for making the scene.

Started out as a lightning fast Raytracer (phong/diffuse/shadow samples and all that), but now has pathtracer renderer alongside it. 

It'll eventually be awesome, hopefully sooner than later.
