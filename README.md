# Tracer
A "simple" C++ RayTracer made to learn more about graphics.

The goals are to produce high quality images fast using interesting techniques.  
Started out as a lightning fast Raytracer (phong/diffuse/shadow, refraction, aa samples etc), but now has pathtracer renderer alongside it.  
It's pretty cool, and hopefully it'll be cooler soon.
